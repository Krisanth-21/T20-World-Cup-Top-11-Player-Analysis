# T20-World-Cup-Top-11-Player-Analysis
This project analyzes the 2022 T20 World Cup data to determine the top 11 players based on their performance. I used ParseHub to collect data from the ESPNcricinfo website, then cleaned and transformed it with NumPy and pandas, Python libraries, and created dashboards in Power BI.
